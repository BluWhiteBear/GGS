We've been hard at work over the past few weeks working on bug fixes, performance improvements, new quality of live (QOL) features, and disk handling improvements. We're excited for everybody to get their hands on these changes, and appreciate all of the feedback we've received thus far! A few of the new features and bug fixes that are in the works won't be featured in this update, as they need a little more time in the oven; rest assured we've received your feedback and are working on it! - Bl√º</p>
